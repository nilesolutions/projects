							<h1>Home Nations Teams not the only let-down for UK Rugby</h1>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="container container-alt blog-holder">
						<p>So, the Home Nations are out of the Rugby World Cup following failure, white-washes, controversy, and the embarrassing title of the first Rugby World Cup hosts to go out in the pool stages. There is no denying that the Northern Hemisphere performances were disappointing and that Southern Hemisphere Rugby is an entirely different game. However the performances of England, Wales, Ireland, Scotland &amp; France were not the only let-down of the World Cup 2015.</p>
						<p>I regularly commute by train and was left aghast when recently visiting Rugby station.</p>
						<div class="img-holder">

						</div>
						<p>The world’s eyes are on England and Wales for the World Cup, at a time when the game is growing in popularity like never before. 400,000 fans have travelled from across the world to attend games and visit the home of the game.</p>
						<p>The RFU website describes the town of Rugby as,</p>
						<blockquote>“Known throughout the world as the birthplace of the game. It was here, in 1823, while playing football at his school that the young William Webb Ellis picked up the ball and ran. This moment, which took place on The Close at Rugby School, is the origin of today’s games of Rugby Union, Rugby League, and American Football and today you can visit the momentous spot and a dedicated museum.”</blockquote>
						<p>So why did we fail so spectacularly to create a memorable visitor experience from start to finish? Why, when fans from across the world leave the train at Rugby station are they greeted with construction hoarding, an empty helpdesk, a string of poxy bunting and a direction sign that is illegible, because it so badly positioned?</p>
						<p>This is not a criticism of Rugby Borough Council, Virgin Trains, the RFU or any organisation in particular. It’s great that Rugby station is finally getting ticket barriers (hence the construction hoarding) and I understand Rugby Council put on some great Fanzone and family activities. But as a nation, did we not get our heads together to ensure that we created an entirely memorable experience for both national and international visitors? This is a record breaking tournament in terms of tickets sold, so surely there should have been someone overseeing the complete end-to-end experience to ensure it was impressive, slick and unforgettable. This was a missed opportunity to show ourselves in the best possible light, helping to maximise visitor impressions (and spend) and build future tourism to the UK. Surely we have enough insight and experience from the Olympics 2012 to know how to create amazing visitor experiences and understand the importance of every interaction on the visitor journey?</p>
						<p>It has been estimated that England’s early exit could mean a £500m hit for businesses including pubs, hotels and supermarkets (The Guardian) but I suspect there is lot more lost revenue opportunity if all the visitor locations and attractions are of the same standard as Rugby station.</p>
